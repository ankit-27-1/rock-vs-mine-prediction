SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction 🎯

Overview:
This project is an end-to-end machine learning model that classifies sonar signals as either rocks or mines using Python. The dataset consists of sonar signals bounced off underwater objects, and the goal is to build a predictive model that distinguishes between metallic mines and natural rocks.

Technologies Used:
Python 🐍
Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)
Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Key Features
✅ Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed sonar signal data for model training.
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized feature distributions and correlations.
✅ Model Training & Evaluation: Implemented Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest, achieving high classification accuracy.
✅ Deployment: Saved the trained model for future predictions.

How to Run
Install dependencies:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Run the model:
python sonar_prediction.py

Dataset
The dataset is sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains 208 sonar readings with 60 frequency-based features.

Results
📊 Achieved high accuracy in classifying sonar signals using optimized ML models.
